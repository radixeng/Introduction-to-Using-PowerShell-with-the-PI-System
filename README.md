# Introduction-to-Using-PowerShell-with-the-PI-System

PowerShell is a useful programming language that can be run on just about any Windows machine "out of the box" with no installation required. This combined with its tight integration with the .NET framework makes it a very useful tool for working with the PI System in client environments.
 
This session will first provide a basic introduction to PowerShell. Once we've warmed up with this, we'll go over the ways in which we can use it to interact with the PI System. Then, as time permits, we'll go over the process of building some useful scripts that can make many PI System tasks less tedious (OSIsoft's PowerShell module, direct .NET bindings for AF SDK, etc.). Attendees can expect to walk away with a useful script or two but more importantly, they'll have a good starting point and be pointed in the right direction for learning more.
 
This is intended to be a hands on session! To take full advantage of this, you will need a PI System you can connect to from your own workstation. (Please don't use a client's system for this, of course.)
 
A recording will be made available for those who are unable to make this time work for them.

## What I Hate About PowerShell
- Too many creative freedoms with syntax.
- Similar to C# but syntax is much more verbose.
- Arrays of one are automatically converted from arrays.
- Stuck on PowerShell 5 (everything beyond this isn't bundled with Windows).
- Performance (can get around this by compiling C# code or using prepackaged dll's.)
